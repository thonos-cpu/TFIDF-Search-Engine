# TFIDF-Search-Engine
This project implements a complete Information Retrieval and Clustering pipeline on a medical dataset. It features a VSM using Raw, Logarithmic, and Augmented TF-IDF schemes , optimized via Grid Search and scikit-learn. Documents are further analyzed using KMeans and Agglomerative clustering with both TF-IDF and Sentence-Transformer embeddings.
